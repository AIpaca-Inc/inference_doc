# Authentication

Authentication is required when Aibro APIs are called for the first time.

Albro allows one of the following two ways to authenticate:

- Access token (**recommend**): This is supplied using a series of characters prefixed by "secret\_...", and can be found in the Aibro Console on the [humming page](https://aipaca.ai/humming).
- Email & password: These credentials are the same that were used to register on the [AIbro website](https://aipaca.ai).

*ps: "humming" is literally how an alpaca "greets" people*ðŸ˜‰
