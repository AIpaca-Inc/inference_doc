AIbro is a serverless MLOps tool that helps data scientists train & deploy AI models on cloud platforms in 2 minutes.

The first step in the process is training a machine learning model, whereas this document focuses on the second step, cloud-based machine learning inference. If you are also interested in learning about training a model, please refer to the [training document](https://doc.aipaca.ai/training).

## Why AIbro Inference?

- Cost-effectiveness. Compared to ordinary on-demand instances, Albro uses [spot](#spot-vs-on-demand-instance) and [standby](#standby-and-cooling-instances) instances to achieve 85% savings.
- Ease of use. Aibro is easy to use and it only takes two minutes to deploy a machine learning model.
- Flexibility. Our platform supports virtually all of the popular model frameworks in the market.
