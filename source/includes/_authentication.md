# Authentication

Authentication is required when APIs are called for the first time.

AIbro allows one of the following two ways to verify authentication:

- Access token (**recommend**): a series of characters starts with "secret\_..."; it can be found on the [humming page](https://aipaca.ai/humming).
- Email & password: same as you register at the AIbro [website](https://aipaca.ai).

*ps: "humming" is literally how an alpaca "greets" people*ðŸ˜‰
